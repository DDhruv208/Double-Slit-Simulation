# Double Slit Simulation

This project simulates the famous **Double-Slit Experiment** using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  
It shows how a Gaussian wave packet (representing a photon or electron) passes through two slits and produces an **interference pattern** on the screen.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## ðŸ”¬ Features
- Time-evolution of a quantum wave packet
- Double-slit barrier visualization
- Animated interference fringes
- Output video (`doubleslit.mp4`)

## â–¶ Watch the animation
If GitHub supports it (file < 25MB), you can [watch the video here](doubleslit.mp4).  
Otherwise, download `doubleslit.mp4` from this repo and play it locally.

## Run
```bash
python doubleslit.py
